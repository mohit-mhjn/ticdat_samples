# `ticdat` examples - In development

**DISCLAIMER**: These are examples created by me (mohit-mhjn) to illustrate different things while teaching ticdat. I refer to these examples in my medium [blogs](mohitmhjn.medium.com). Please feel free to pull, fork, include in tests and contribute. Comments and feedback on this are welcome.

I created these besides the ticdat's own diet and iris example because of two reasons.
1. I wanted to illustrate through something which is free of dependencies, diet and iris require `gurobi` and `scikit-learn` to be installed. Sometimes not desirable in tests or virtual env.

2. I also want to add some illustrations on advanced functionality that is not covered through simple examples and standard scheme of execution.

### Setup
To run these scripts you might have to install ticdat from pip or you could install it from the [source](https://github.com/ticdat/ticdat)


```
pip install ticdat
```

### Description

Each of the examples have their independent directories and the sample input files are included.

- `medium_example_1` illustrates the basic data integrity setup as described here.
- Working on next blog.
